## Introduction & Fundamental Principles

Required Readings:
* Mankiw, Ch. 1-2 Thinking Like an Economist
* Mankiw, Ch. 3 Interdependence & Gains from Trade
 
Suggested Readings:

The readings below provide valuable background, but you don't need to read them all this week! They treat themes that we will return to throughout the course, so work them in as you find time.

Friedman, David. [*Price Theory: An Intermediate Text*](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html), second edition, 1990. Chapters 1 ("What is Economics?") and 2 ("How Economists Think.") provide an excellent introduction to how economists see the world.

Read, Leonard E. "[I, Pencil: My Family Tree as told to Leonard E. Read](http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=112&layout=html)". *The Freeman*, December 1958. See also this video with [Milton Friedman's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67tHtpac5ws).

Smith, Adam. [*An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3300), 1776. [Also available in PDF or EPUB via Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=Q1XlnGzcIa8C&dq=adam+smith+wealth+of+nations). Too long for me to expect you to read in its entirely this semester! But see Book IV, Chapter 2 (Of restraints upon importation from foreign countries of such goods as can be produced at home) for Smith's (in)famous statement about the "invisible hand". Book I, Chapters 1-3 might also be worth giving a go.

Smith, George, Jack High, and Wendy McElroy. *Adam Smith: The Wealth of Nations*, 1985. This audio book from Knowledge Products is now available for free from Cato Institute in [module 4](http://www.cato.org/cato-university/home-study-course/module4) and [module 5](http://www.cato.org/cato-university/home-study-course/module5) of their home study course. The accents in the dramatizations are kind of hokey, but they do make the quotes strangely memorable. While I would not consider this the definitive statement on Smith and his philosophy, there is a lot of good background here. Not required reading, but worth your time while working off the dreaded "freshman 15" at the gym.

Levy, David M., and Sandra J. Peart. "[The Secret History of the Dismal Science. Part I. Economics, Religion and Race in the 19th Century.](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal.html)" *Library of Economics and Liberty*, January 22, 2001. The true origin of the epithet "the dismal science" is much more interesting than most who hurl it realize...

Bastiat, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric. "[What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen](http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss1.html)", 1848. You may tire of this essay before you read all the examples, but read the first ("the broken window"): it's the one that everyone refers to as the general case of the fallacy against which he argues throughout. The end of the third section ("taxes") is also pretty funny. At least, I think so.
