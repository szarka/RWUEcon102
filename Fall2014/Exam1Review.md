# Exam 1 Review Questions

1. Eat a Peach

Suppose the demand for peaches is described by the function Q = 20 − 2P while the supply of peaches is described by the function Q = 2P − 4, where Q is peaches per day and P is dollars. Graph the supply & demand in the usual manner, labeling everything appropriately. Find the equilibrium price and quantity and label them on your graph. What is the total revenue at the equilibrium price? What is the price elasticity of demand at this price? (Is it elastic or inelastic?) Is this the price at which total revenue is maximized? If not, would the maximum revenue occur at a lower or higher price?

Suppose the demand for peaches increases (what might cause this?), so that one more peach would be demanded at any particular price. How will the equilibrium price and quantity change?

2. Cheap Apples?

The market for apples in Bristol is in equilibrium at a price of $1/apple and a quantity of 1,000 apples/week before the town council passes a law limiting the price of apples to $0.90 each. Illustrate the effect of this new price ceiling on a graph. How might the behavior of market participants change?

3. Survivor Comparative Advantage

Alice and Bob are stranded on a tropical island, where they must survive on a diet of delicious nuts and succulent roast peccary. (Luckily, neither Alice nor Bob is vegetarian, Jewish, Muslim, or allergic to nuts!) Alice can gather 2 kg of nuts each day, or she can spend 5 days to produce 1 roast peccary. Bob can gather only 1 kg of nuts each day, but he can produce a roasted peccary in only 4 days. What is Alice’s opportunity cost of gathering nuts? What is Bob’s opportunity cost of gathering nuts? In order to maximize food production, who should specialize in gathering nuts?

4. “I Rob Banks”

In the imaginary state of Calitexacut, the average armed robbery results in a five year prison term and the average murder results in a twenty year prison term. But Calitexacut recently passed the Three Strikes Law, which mandates life in prison with no possibility of parole for anyone convicted of three felonies (such as armed robbery or murder). Career bank robber P.B. Floyd lives, loves, and robs banks in Calitexacut and has already been convicted of two armed robberies. Floyd is planning another bank robbery tomorrow despite the Three Strikes law. How does the Three Strikes Law impact Floyd’s decision about whether to shoot the bank guard while robbing the bank?
