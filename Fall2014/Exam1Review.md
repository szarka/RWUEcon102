## Eat a Peach

Suppose the demand for peaches is described by the function Q = 20 − 2P while the supply of peaches is described by the function Q = 2P − 4, where Q is peaches per day and P is dollars. Graph the supply & demand in the usual manner, labeling everything appropriately. Find the equilibrium price and quantity and label them on your graph. What is the total revenue at the equilibrium price? What is the price elasticity of demand at this price? (Is it elastic or inelastic?) Is this the price at which total revenue is maximized? If not, would the maximum revenue occur at a lower or higher price?

Suppose the demand for peaches increases (what might cause this?), so that one more peach would be demanded at any particular price. How will the equilibrium price and quantity change?

## Cheap Apples?

The market for apples in Bristol is in equilibrium at a price of $1/apple and a quantity of 1,000 apples/week before the town council passes a law limiting the price of apples to $0.90 each. Illustrate the effect of this new price ceiling on a graph. How might the behavior of market participants change?

## Survivor Comparative Advantage

Alice and Bob are stranded on a tropical island, where they must survive on a diet of delicious nuts and succulent roast peccary. (Luckily, neither Alice nor Bob is vegetarian, Jewish, Muslim, or allergic to nuts!) Alice can gather 2 kg of nuts each day, or she can spend 5 days to produce 1 roast peccary. Bob can gather only 1 kg of nuts each day, but he can produce a roasted peccary in only 4 days. What is Alice’s opportunity cost of gathering nuts? What is Bob’s opportunity cost of gathering nuts? In order to maximize food production, who should specialize in gathering nuts?

## “I Rob Banks”

In the imaginary state of Calitexacut, the average armed robbery results in a five year prison term and the average murder results in a twenty year prison term. But Calitexacut recently passed the Three Strikes Law, which mandates life in prison with no possibility of parole for anyone convicted of three felonies (such as armed robbery or murder). Career bank robber P.B. Floyd lives, loves, and robs banks in Calitexacut and has already been convicted of two armed robberies. Floyd is planning another bank robbery tomorrow despite the Three Strikes law. How does the Three Strikes Law impact Floyd’s decision about whether to shoot the bank guard while robbing the bank?


# Answers

## Eat a Peach

Here's what your graph should look like:

[Supply and Demand for Peaches](https://github.com/szarka/RWUEcon102/blob/master/Fall2014/PeachSD.png)

You could find this by solving the original equations for P and then graphing (find the intercepts and connect the dots), or do it the hard way by plugging in some values for P and seeing what Q's pop out.

As you can see, the equilibrium price is $6 and the equlibrium quantity is 8 peaches per day. You could find this by solving the system of equations, or by inspection of the graph. (Either way, plug the values you find back into the original equations to check your work.)

Total revenue at the equlibrium is $48 per day. With some arithmetic, you can find that this is not the maximum. For example, at $7, quantity demanded is 6, making TR = 42. But at $5, quantity demanded is 10, making TR = 50. Since lowering the price increases TR, demand is price inelastic at the equilibrium price.

The lazy way to find the revenue-maximizing price is to use calculus to find an expression for the elasticity and set it equal to -1. You get 5.

## Cheap Apples?

This is an example of a price ceiling. This price ceiling is binding, so your graph should show that the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supply at a price of $0.90. In other words, there is *excess demand* (or a *shortage*).

Since price can no longer ration access to apples effectively, the situation will be resolved some other way. For example, a black market in apples may arise (and price may be higher than $1 on the black market!); apples suppliers may engage in costless discrimination ("no apples for you"); apples buyers may waste time standing in line; and the apples that are sold may not reach the buyers who value them most in dollar terms.

## Survivor Comparative Advantage

Alice's opportunity cost of producing nuts is 1/5 of a peccary per 2 kg of nuts, or 1/10 peccary per kg. Bob's opportunity cost of producing nuts is 1/4 of a peccary per kg of nuts. Since Bob's cost is lower, he has the comparative advantage in nut production, and he should specialize in producing nuts while Alice hunts the wild, delicious peccary. (Mmm... bacon...)

You could, of course, get to the same answer by calculating the cost of peccary production.

## “I Rob Banks”

This question is a bit of a curveball, but the key is to think about the *marginal* effect of the two options.

If this were Floyd's first crime, shooting the bank guard would add (on average) 15 years to Floyd's sentence if caught. But, since Floyd will be subject to the Three Strikes law, he now faces life in prison either way. Unless shooting the guard increases Floyd's chances of getting caught a great deal, this is now a more attractive option. Paradoxically, a law like this *could* increase the severity of the crimes commited.
